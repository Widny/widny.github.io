  <h1>Week 4</h1>


 <p>One of the biggest issue on the tech industry is lack of diversity  Google recently published data about their workforce. 70% male and 30% female. In leadership, 79% are men while the other 21% were women. In terms of race, 61% white, 30% Asian, 3% Hispanic, 2% Black, and 1%  other.Their data however did not include any data about the average age of the workforce.</p> 

<p>Being an african american male, I am concerned about these statistics and question whether if i will ever be given a fair chance a any tech company. However, I have a deeper concern over the the lack of women in the tech and more importantly the treatment of the women who are. I find it ironic that an industry who claims to change the world is still stuck in the past.</p> 

<p>The big question is why. We have seen women who have had tremendous success in the tech world like Marrisa Mayer, CEO of Yahoo, or Sheryl Sandberg, COO of Facebook, Leah Busque, CEO of Task Rabbit, Meg Whitman CEO of HP,  and  Cher Wang, Founder &amp Chairman of HTC. There list can go on and on of women who have made a big impact in different roles in the tech industry, yet we still to ignore them.</p>


<P>I personally believe that most women actually have certain skills that make them a better candidate than male. They are more resourceful, the pay closer attention to detail than man, and I also believe they are better communicators.</P> 

<p>So how do we fix it. Many people claim that the reason for lack of women in the tech space is because not may women receives a computer science degree or related fields. While it is true,  that more women should get computer science degree, I think it is an excuse. I would like to see data about the women who graduated last year and how a=many of them received a job.</p>

<p>I believe in order to fix this problem, the tech industry has to change their culture regarding diversity and especially towards women. Weâ€™ll be amazed the value that women can add to the tech world if we give them the opportunity and do not make hurtful sexist remarks.</p>
