  <h1>Week 1</h1>
    <p>So I watched the Shereef fireside chat. it was a little over an hour but I enjoyed ever minute of it</p>
    <p>First of all, I appreciated hearing the story of how Dev Boot camp was formed and how the students and Shereef put their hands together to make that experience worth while. That is why, the analogy of kitchen vs. table made so much sense.  If we all come to the table expecting  Dev Bootcamp's staff and professors alone to provide us the experience we paid for than we really will not take full advantage of how this program can truly propel us into our careers.</p>
    <p>The video really validated my take on the DBC experience. Although, it will be an intense few weeks, one will be very happy by the result. I believe that the experience will be collaborative, challenging, intellectually stimulating, and emotionally stimulating. I know that if I become a chef in the kitchen, I will develop into the programmer and person I want to be</p>
    <p>The video made me understand that they are not looking for the smartest individuals, but they are looking for those who are driven and puts in an effort. That is describes me.  I am not the most intelligent in math but persistence, practice, an more than average effort made me get a grade A in all my math classes.</p>
    <p>I also got the  impression of the importance of team culture which is extremely important in everything but especially in this industry. By working as a team we learn from each other and improve our craft</p>

    <p>There are several ways I see myself engaging in tis type of culture:</p>

    <p>First, become a chef in the kitchen by asking myself how can I contribute to make this experience a great one for myself, my peers, and the professors. I am an introvert but I will challenge myself to being vocal, being active, being helpful, and most importantly being mindful. Focus on building relationships.</p>
    <p>Second, expose my vulnerability anb be able to admit that i do not really know everything and i should not be embarrassed by it. If I donâ€™t vocalize my confusion than I will be robbing myself from learning.<p> 
    <p>Third, be disciplined and really apply the materials given to me by Dev Bootcamp and finding other resources that can help means others.</p> 

    <p>As I continue this journey with my cohorts and DBC, I am sure I will come up with more ways to engage myself in this community.</p>

    <p>My impression of DBC has changed but in a good way. Based on my conversations with  alumni of DBS during office hours and the DBC staff, I can really feel that they are looking out for my best interest.</p> 

    <p>I am always a ball of nervousness. I am sure I will fit with the culture of DBC but I am nervous about whether I will be able to keep up. But I am ready and excited to challenge myself. I can not wait to meet everyone and be immersed in the experience.</p> 

     <p>Many people have said that having to much chefs in the kitchen messes up the result. I believe in DBC we will make a wonderful mess.</p>
