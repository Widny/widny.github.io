		<p> Jackthreads- the web page does not really solve a prblem. The website is very easy to browse for cltohinh and accessories targeted to men at discounted prices. I guess it does great to curatethe different clothing by discount sales, product, and designer. There is alot on the page which works for a online flash/discount site. </p>

        <p> Business Insider- I go this site to getmost of my news specifically business, economics, and tecjnology. I really like that it continues to add new content. If you refreh the page 30 minutes later you will find that they added about 10 more content. The only thing i dislike about the website is that it looks a little too busy for me. I like simple clean aesthetics. </p>

    <h2>Audible</h2>
		<p>Audible- This website helps me purchase audible books to listen to in my car. The website makes it very easy to browse product. They curate a library based on past purchases or rating. They aslo curate based on specific genres and best selling list. I did not find any visual challenges. It was simple. Product was the focus.</p>
