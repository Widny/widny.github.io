  <h1>Week 2</h1>

  <p>If you want to understand the difference between margins, padding, and borders. look no furthan than the box model to understand the concept. Please see exaple below.</p>

  <p>It really helps me to think of it as a picture frame. Every content whether it be an image or text is inside the box. You can determine the size and width of your content for example img { width: 50px;}.<p>


  <P> In the example above you can see that the outside box is the margin. This affects where other boxes are positioned in relation to each other or boundaries within a webpage. If you set a margin to 0, the margin will be positioned very close to the other content. If you set a margin to 10px, it will seperate the boxes. 
  
  <p>The next box inside the margin is the border. The border is visible as oppose to oppose to the margin which is invisible. Depending on your design you may want to set a border for style reasons. You can create your border with different colors and also the size of the border. Please see below<p>

  <h2>Hi</h2>
  <h3>Hi</h3>

  <p>The next box is the padding. If you do not set a padding then the content will be sittng right up against the border.<p>
