	<h1>Week 3</h1>


		<p>According to the Gregoric Thinking Style quiz, my thinking style is predominately concrete random closely followed by Abstract Random. As I looked more into these two different thinking styles, I was amazed at how I related to the different attributes.</p> 

		<p>The research I found regarding concrete-random suggests that I learn best by experimenting and working the problem on my own and  learn best from trial and error . According the abstract random thinking style, I learn best in a personalized environment and able to participate in group activities. Also both thinking styles are initiative and instinctive.</p>

		<p>Going forward, I will incorporate more creativity and imagination on my  work. I will also  try to practice more of the material by working more problems on my own as it is the best way for me to learn.</p> 

		<p>The past few weeks I noticed that I have been more panicked, frustrated ,and super critical of myself. This has effected the way I learn best. I have allowed the fixed mindset to overtake me. I will be more mindful of my mindset so that I can continue to grow and learn.</p>
